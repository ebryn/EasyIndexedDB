# EasyIndexedDB

EasyIndexedDB is an IndexedDB wrapper that exposes a promise-based API where possible. The goal is to also offer a simple higher-level API on top of IndexedDB.

Still a WIP, docs soon... until then, look at the source and tests.

Want to use IndexedDB on more browsers? Check out [IndexedDBShim](http://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim/).
